# Joint Modeling and Dynamic Ensemble Forecasting of Influenza Vaccine Responses from Complex Longitudinal Trajectories

This Github page provides code for reproducing the results in the manuscript: Joint Modeling and Dynamic Ensemble Forecasting of Influenza Vaccine Responses from Complex Longitudinal Trajectories.

## Real-world implications
The forecasts and simulations using advance statistics models can enhance our understanding of vaccine-induced immunity, aligning well with the goals of the [Computational Models of Immunity to Pertussis Booster Vaccinations (CMI-PB) Project](https://www.cmi-pb.org/blog/prediction-challenge-overview/).
## Summary
Longitudinal measurement trajectories have become increasingly valuable for deepening our predictive understanding of vaccine-induced immunity. However, the complexity of immune interaction patterns inherent in these trajectories, along with their incompleteness and high heterogeneity, introduces significant methodological challenges for predictive modeling. To address these challenges, we introduce the Joint Modeling and Dynamic Forecasting (JMDF) framework to enhance vaccine response prediction. JMDF provides four key advances: (1) adaptive use of non-missing longitudinal measurements as covariates without requiring imputation; (2) a novel application of Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) to  enable information sharing across individuals, thereby achieving efficient modeling and interpretation of complex interactions; (3) joint forecasting of responses to multiple vaccine subtypes while allowing deep within-individual dependencies across viral subtypes; and (4) an efficient ensemble forecasting strategy that integrates vaccination trajectory patterns. This work advances modern statistical modeling in public health, particularly in the area of vaccine response prediction and immune response simulation, with the potential to support personalized vaccination strategies.

## Data from the human influenza vaccine cohort study
To understand vaccine-induced immunity, an ongoing human influenza vaccine cohort study is being conducted. The cohort was initiated in 2013 at two sites: one in Florida (FL) and the other in Pennsylvania (PA). Since 2016, the study has been primarily conducted at the [University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens, Georgia, United States](https://cider.uga.edu/about-cider). Data were illustrated in <a href="#Figure1">Figure 1</a>.

## Simulations
<!-- The estimates of the nonlinear function closely match the true function and remain remarkably robust across several different choices of the number of knots used in the RW2 approximation, as shown in <a href="#Figure3">Figure 1</a>.

Furthermore, JMDF-GMRF successfully recovers complex interaction patterns, whether generated from smoothing functions (<a href="#Figure2">Figure 2</a>) or simulated from Mat√©rn fields.

## Real data analysis using the UGA cohort
Methods consistently reveal similar nonlinear associations between BMI and vaccination responses, showing positive effects at both low and high BMI levels, as shown in <a href="#Figure3">Figure 3</a>.
